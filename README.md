# PiiString

> Personally identifiable information (PII) is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person â€” [EU GDPR](https://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/article-4-definitions-GDPR.htm).

The idea is to have `PiiString` type as much interchangeable with `String` as possible to simplify refactoring existing code which uses the `String`. Then, within the application boundary it should behave like usual `String`, however crossing application boundaries it should be encoded/encrypted/hashed.
